## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

**404 Error on Lemonsqueezy Checkout**

The checkout URLs are returning 404 errors. The IDs provided appear to be **product IDs**, but Lemonsqueezy checkout links need **variant IDs** (numeric).

### Current Checkout URLs (WRONG)
```
https://talkwithaira.lemonsqueezy.com/buy/210ff3d5-eb49-43ba-b978-e058d4ebe18c?checkout[email]=...
```

### What We Need
- **Variant IDs** (numeric, e.g., `12345`) instead of UUIDs
- These can be found in Lemonsqueezy Dashboard ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Click product ‚Üí Variants section

## üîß Next Steps (TODO)

### 1. ‚ö° URGENT: Get Correct Variant IDs
- [ ] Go to https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/products
- [ ] Click on "Aira Plus" product
- [ ] Go to "Variants" section
- [ ] Copy the **numeric variant ID** (e.g., `12345`)
- [ ] Repeat for "Aira Premium"
- [ ] Update `.env.local`:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_LEMONSQUEEZY_PRODUCT_PLUS=<numeric_variant_id>
  NEXT_PUBLIC_LEMONSQUEEZY_PRODUCT_PREMIUM=<numeric_variant_id>
  ```
- [ ] Restart the server: `npm run dev`

### 2. Test Checkout Flow
- [ ] Once product IDs are verified, test the checkout again
- [ ] Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- [ ] Verify redirect to checkout-success page

### 3. Complete Webhook Integration
- [ ] Get webhook secret from Lemonsqueezy Dashboard
- [ ] Add to `.env.local` as `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- [ ] Implement database query to get user ID from email in webhook handler
- [ ] Test webhook by completing a test purchase

### 4. Plan Update Logic
- [ ] Implement email-to-user-id lookup in webhook handler
- [ ] Call `updatePlan()` function when subscription events occur
- [ ] Test that user plan updates after purchase

### 5. Success Page Redirect
- [ ] Verify checkout-success page properly updates user plan
- [ ] Test redirect to dashboard with `?upgraded=true` parameter

## üìã Files Modified

- `.env.local` - Updated with Lemonsqueezy credentials
- `app/pricing/page.tsx` - Updated checkout handler
