## 🧠 Aira's New Capabilities

### Intent Recognition
Aira now detects:
- Panic attacks
- Anxiety spikes
- Self-harm ideation
- Suicidal ideation
- Grief
- Anger
- Rumination
- Sleep issues
- Celebrations
- And more...

### Conversation State Management
Aira adapts her approach based on:
- **Stabilize**: De-escalate panic/crisis
- **Explore**: Reflective questions for rumination
- **Plan**: Tiny steps for low motivation
- **Anchor**: Grounding for grief/anger
- **Close**: Kind wrap-up for celebrations

### Risk Assessment
Aira evaluates:
- Passive ideation (thoughts only)
- Active ideation (intent + plan)
- Imminent risk (intent + plan + time + access)

### Personalization
Aira learns:
- User preferences (emojis, pace, faith)
- Triggers and soothers
- Support circle
- Baseline mood
- Conversation history

## 🔄 Response Pipeline Example

**User**: "I'm feeling really anxious and can't focus on work"

**Aira's Pipeline**:
1. **Acknowledge**: "I hear that anxiety is making it hard to focus right now."
2. **Name need**: "It sounds like you need to feel grounded."
3. **Offer choices**: "Want to try a quick grounding exercise, talk more about what's worrying you, or take a tiny break?"
4. **Deliver tool**: "Let's try 5-4-3-2-1. Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste."
5. **Check-in**: "How did that feel? Want to try another?"

## 🚨 Crisis Protocol Example

**User**: "I can't do this anymore. I want to end it."

**Aira's Response**:
1. **Validate**: "I'm really sorry you're feeling this much pain. I'm here with you."
2. **Stabilize**: "Let's try box breathing together. In 4, hold 4, out 4, hold 4."
3. **Connect**: "Would talking to someone live help tonight? Samaritans (116 123) is 24/7 and free."
4. **Offer options**: "You could also text someone you trust, or we can keep talking here."
5. **Stay present**: "I'm not going anywhere. We can get through this together."

const intents = detectIntent("I'm feeling really anxious and can't breathe")
// Output: ["panic", "anxiety_spike"]

const state = detectConversationState(intents)
// Output: "stabilize"

const risk = assessRisk("I want to kill myself tonight with pills")
// Output: "imminent"
```

### Test in Chat
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/chat
2. Sign up or login
3. Try different messages:
   - "I'm feeling anxious"
   - "I can't stop thinking about..."
   - "I'm so happy today!"
