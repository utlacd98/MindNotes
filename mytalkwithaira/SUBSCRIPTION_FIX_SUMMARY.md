# ✅ Subscription Update Fix - Complete

## Problem
User was paying through Lemonsqueezy checkout but the subscription status was never updated in the app. Dashboard still showed "Free Plan" after payment.

## Root Causes
1. **No user registry**: No way to look up users by email on the server side
2. **Incomplete webhook**: Lemonsqueezy webhook had TODO comments and didn't update user plans
3. **Missing verify-session endpoint**: Dashboard was calling `/api/stripe/verify-session` which didn't exist
4. **No session verification**: Dashboard wasn't checking the user's plan after returning from checkout

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created User Registry System (`lib/user-registry.ts`)
- File-based storage to map email addresses to user IDs and plans
- Functions:
  - `registerUser()` - Register user after login/signup
  - `getUserByEmail()` - Look up user by email
  - `updateUserPlanByEmail()` - Update user's plan (called by webhook)

### 2. Updated Auth Context (`lib/auth-context.tsx`)
- Modified `login()` and `signup()` to call `/api/auth/register-user` after successful authentication
- This registers the user in the server-side registry so webhooks can find them

### 3. Created User Registration API (`app/api/auth/register-user/route.ts`)
- POST endpoint that registers users in the file-based registry
- Called by auth context after login/signup

### 4. Fixed Lemonsqueezy Webhook (`app/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy/route.ts`)
- Replaced TODO comments with actual implementation
- Now handles three events:
  - `order.created` - New purchase/subscription
  - `subscription.updated` - Plan change
  - `subscription.cancelled` - Downgrade to free
- Calls `updateUserPlanByEmail()` to update user's plan

### 5. Created Verify-Session Endpoint (`app/api/stripe/verify-session/route.ts`)
- GET endpoint that checks user's current plan by email
- Returns: `{ success: true, plan: "plus" | "premium" | "free", userId, name }`
- Called by dashboard after Lemonsqueezy redirect

### 6. Updated Dashboard (`components/dashboard/dashboard-content.tsx`)
- Now passes user email when verifying session
- Calls `/api/stripe/verify-session?email={email}&session_id={sessionId}`
- Updates user's plan in auth context when verification succeeds
- Shows "Upgrade Successful!" banner

## How It Works Now

```
1. User signs up/logs in
   ↓
2. Auth context calls /api/auth/register-user
   ↓
3. User is registered in file-based registry
   ↓
4. User goes to pricing and clicks "Upgrade"
   ↓
5. Redirected to Lemonsqueezy checkout
   ↓
6. User completes payment
   ↓
7. Lemonsqueezy sends webhook to /api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy
   ↓
8. Webhook updates user's plan in registry
   ↓
9. User redirected back to dashboard with session_id
   ↓
10. Dashboard calls /api/stripe/verify-session with user email
   ↓
11. API returns updated plan from registry
   ↓
12. Dashboard updates user's plan in auth context
   ↓
13. User sees "Upgrade Successful!" and plan is updated ✅
```

## Files Created
- `lib/user-registry.ts` - User email-to-ID mapping system
- `app/api/auth/register-user/route.ts` - User registration endpoint
- `app/api/stripe/verify-session/route.ts` - Session verification endpoint

## Files Modified
- `lib/auth-context.tsx` - Added user registration calls
- `app/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy/route.ts` - Implemented webhook handlers
- `components/dashboard/dashboard-content.tsx` - Added session verification

## Testing

### Test Flow
1. Sign up with a new email (e.g., `test@example.com`)
2. Go to `/pricing`
3. Click "Upgrade to Aira Plus" or "Upgrade to Aira Premium"
4. Complete Lemonsqueezy checkout (use test card if available)
5. You should be redirected to dashboard
6. Dashboard should show "Upgrade Successful!" banner
7. Plan should be updated to "Aira Plus" or "Aira Premium"

### Admin Bypass (No Payment)
- Sign up with: `owner@aira.ai`, `admin1@aira.ai`, or `admin2@aira.ai`
- You'll automatically get "Aira Premium" access without payment

## Notes
- User data is stored in `.data/user-registry.json` (file-based)
- This is a temporary solution - for production, use a real database
- Lemonsqueezy webhook secret should be configured in `.env.local` for signature verification
- The system now properly tracks user plans across sessions
