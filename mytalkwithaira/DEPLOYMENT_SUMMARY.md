## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Quick Start (3 Steps)

#### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for production deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Option A: Using CLI
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod

# Option B: Using Dashboard
# Go to https://vercel.com and import your repository
```

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables, add:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY`
- `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (your production domain)
- All other variables from `.env.local`

## 🎯 Maintenance Mode Setup

### Option 1: Show "Application Received" Message (Recommended)

Edit `app/page.tsx` and add this at the top:

```typescript
import { redirect } from "next/navigation"

export default function HomePage() {
  redirect("/maintenance")
}
```

Then deploy:
```bash
git add app/page.tsx
git commit -m "Enable maintenance mode"
git push origin main
```

**Result**: Users see the "Application Received" message
**Other pages**: Still accessible (for testing)

### Option 2: Keep App Live

Skip the above step and deploy normally. App will be fully functional.

### Option 3: Toggle with Environment Variable

Add to `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINTENANCE_MODE=true
```

Then in `app/page.tsx`:
```typescript
if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINTENANCE_MODE === "true") {
  redirect("/maintenance")
}
```
